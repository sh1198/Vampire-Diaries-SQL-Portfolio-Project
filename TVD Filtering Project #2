-- Topic: Vampires Table – Working with LENGTH, WHERE, LIKE, and String Functions

-- Table: Vampires
-- Columns: name (TEXT), coven (TEXT)

-- 1. Get the name and coven of all vampires along with the length of their full identity
-- (name + coven combined)
SELECT name, coven, LENGTH(name) + LENGTH (coven) AS total_identity_length
FROM Vampires
ORDER BY total_identity_length DESC;

-- 2. Get vampires where the combined length of name and coven is greater than 15
SELECT name, coven, LENGTH(name) + LENGTH (coven) AS total_identity_length
FROM Vampires
WHERE LENGTH(name) + LENGTH (coven) > 15
ORDER BY total_identity_length DESC;

-- 3. Find all vampire names that end with 'K'
SELECT name 
FROM Vampires 
WHERE name LIKE '%K';

-- 4. Find all vampire names that end with 'e'
SELECT name 
FROM Vampires 
WHERE name LIKE '%e';

-- 5. Find vampire names that contain the letters 'ar'
SELECT name 
FROM Vampires 
WHERE name LIKE '%ar%';

-- 6. Find all species values from a Characters table that contain 'mp'
SELECT species 
FROM Characters 
WHERE species LIKE '%mp%';

-- 7. List characters where name length is exactly 7 letters
SELECT name, LENGTH(name) AS name_length 
FROM Characters 
WHERE LENGTH(name) = 7;

--Can also use the following query:
SELECT name
FROM Characters 
WHERE name LIKE '_______';

-- 8. Bonus: Find all names containing "a" somewhere in the middle, but not at the beginning
SELECT name 
FROM Characters 
WHERE name LIKE '_%a%';
