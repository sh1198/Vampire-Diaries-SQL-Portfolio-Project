# Vampire-Diaries-SQL-Portfolio-Project
Welcome to my SQL portfolio project, where I used a fictional dataset inspired by The Vampire Diaries universe to practice and demonstrate SQL skills.  This project includes two themed SQL scripts that showcase my proficiency with core SQL concepts like filtering, grouping, and string manipulation.

ðŸ“‚ Project 1: TVD Filtering Project #1
Table Used: Characters
Columns: name, species, age, birth_year

                                          ðŸ’¡ Concepts Practiced:
                                          WHERE with logical conditions

                                          LIKE pattern matching

                                          IN and BETWEEN

                                          GROUP BY with aggregation (AVG)

                                          Filtering using multiple conditions


ðŸ“‚ Project 2: TVD Filtering Project #2
Table Used: Vampires
Columns: name, coven

                                         ðŸ’¡ Concepts Practiced:
                                          String concatenation using ''

                                          Calculating string length with LENGTH()

                                          Complex LIKE patterns

                                          Character length filtering
